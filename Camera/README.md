# Camera


Prerequisites
Install Required Libraries:
OpenCV: pip install opencv-python
pymavlink: pip install pymavlink
numpy: pip install numpy
Hardware Connections:
Connect the camera to the mini-computer (e.g., USB camera).
Connect the Pixhawk to the mini-computer via a serial port (e.g., TELEM2).



Library Imports:
cv2 for computer vision tasks.
numpy for numerical operations.
time for timing operations.
pymavlink for communication with the Pixhawk.
Constants:
UPDATE_RATE: The rate at which the script updates (in Hz).
SAFETY_DISTANCE: The minimum distance to maintain from obstacles.
Pixhawk Connection:
Establish a connection to the Pixhawk using mavutil.mavlink_connection.
Camera Initialization:
Initialize the camera using OpenCV.
Frame Processing:
Convert the frame to grayscale.
Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise.
Use Canny edge detection to find edges.
Find contours and filter them based on area to detect obstacles.
Obstacle Avoidance:
Calculate the avoidance command based on the position of the closest obstacle.
Velocity Command:
Send velocity commands to the Pixhawk using MAVLink.
Main Loop:
Capture frames from the camera.
Process the frames to detect obstacles.
Generate and send avoidance commands.
Display the processed frames with obstacles marked.
Maintain the update rate.
Running the Script
Install Required Libraries:
bash
pip install opencv-python pymavlink numpy

Adjust Serial Port:
Modify the serial port (/dev/ttyACM0) and baud rate (115200) according to your setup.
Run the Script:
bash
python indoor_navigation.py

This script provides a basic implementation of an indoor navigation system using a camera and Pixhawk. You may need to adjust the obstacle detection and avoidance logic based on your specific requirements and environment. Additionally, ensure that your Pixhawk is configured correctly for indoor flight and that you have appropriate safety measures in place when testing the system.
