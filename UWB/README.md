# UWB
The setup:
Multiple UWB anchors placed at known positions in the indoor environment
One UWB tag mounted on the drone
Mini-computer (e.g., Raspberry Pi) connected to the UWB tag and Pixhawk
Pixhawk autopilot for drone control


This script provides a basic framework for indoor navigation using UWB PulseON modules. Here's an explanation of the key components:
Library Imports: We use pymavlink for communication with the Pixhawk and serial for reading data from the UWB modules.
Constants: Define the update rate, number of UWB anchors, and their positions in the environment.
Connections: Establish connections to both the Pixhawk and the UWB module.
UWB Distance Reading: The read_uwb_distances() function reads distance measurements from the UWB modules.
Trilateration: The trilaterate() function estimates the drone's position based on the UWB distance measurements. Note that this is a simplified placeholder and should be replaced with a more robust algorithm for production use.
Position Target Sending: The send_position_target() function sends the estimated position to the Pixhawk as a target for the drone to move towards.
Main Loop: Continuously reads UWB distances, estimates position, and sends position targets to the Pixhawk.
To use this script:
Install required libraries: pip install pymavlink pyserial
Adjust the serial port names (/dev/ttyACM0 for Pixhawk, /dev/ttyUSB0 for UWB module) according to your setup.
Modify the ANCHOR_POSITIONS to match the actual positions of your UWB anchors in the environment.
Implement a more sophisticated trilateration or localization algorithm to improve position estimation accuracy.
Run the script on your mini-computer.
Remember that this is a basic implementation and will need to be expanded and refined for a production system. You'll need to:
Implement error handling and robustness measures.
Integrate obstacle avoidance if necessary.
Implement a more sophisticated path planning algorithm.
Calibrate and fine-tune the system for your specific environment and hardware.
Also, ensure that your Pixhawk is configured correctly for indoor flight and that you have appropriate safety measures in place when testing the system.
