# 2DLidar

The script does the following:
Imports necessary libraries (pymavlink for communication with Pixhawk, rplidar for LiDAR data).
Sets up connections to the Pixhawk and LiDAR.
Defines functions for:
Getting LiDAR data
Processing LiDAR data to detect obstacles
Generating avoidance commands based on obstacle positions
Sending velocity commands to the Pixhawk
The main loop:
Gets LiDAR data
Processes the data to detect obstacles
Generates avoidance commands if necessary
Sends appropriate velocity commands to the Pixhawk
Maintains a consistent update rate
To use this script:
Install required libraries: pip install pymavlink rplidar-roboticia numpy
Adjust the serial port names ('/dev/ttyACM0' for Pixhawk, '/dev/ttyUSB0' for LiDAR) according to your setup.
Run the script on your mini-computer.
Note that this is a basic implementation and may need adjustments based on your specific hardware setup and requirements. You might need to add more sophisticated obstacle avoidance algorithms, path planning, and integration with other sensors (e.g., optical flow for position hold) for a complete indoor navigation system.
Also, ensure that your Pixhawk is configured correctly for indoor flight (e.g., EKF settings, flight modes) and that you have appropriate safety measures in place when testing the system.



Connect the Pixhawk to the mini computer using a serial port, typically TELEM2 on the Pixhawk. Use a USB-to-serial adapter if needed.
Configure the Pixhawk serial port (usually TELEM2) for MAVLink communication:
Set MAV_1_CONFIG = TELEM2
Set MAV_1_MODE = Onboard
Set SER_TEL2_BAUD = 921600 (or higher)
On the mini computer, install the necessary software to communicate with the Pixhawk:
MAVLink libraries (e.g. pymavlink for Python)
MAVROS for ROS integration (if using ROS)
MAVLink Router or MAVProxy for routing MAVLink messages
Set up the serial port on the mini computer:
Identify the serial port (e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0)
Add the user to the tty and dialout groups:
text
sudo usermod -a -G tty $USER
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

Write a script to communicate with the Pixhawk using the MAVLink protocol. Here's a basic Python example using pymavlink:
python
from pymavlink import mavutil

# Connect to the Pixhawk
master = mavutil.mavlink_connection('/dev/ttyUSB0', baud=921600)

# Wait for a heartbeat
master.wait_heartbeat()
print("Heartbeat from system (system %u component %u)" % (master.target_system, master.target_component))

# Send commands or read data as needed

For more advanced setups, consider using MAVROS with ROS or implementing a MAVLink router to handle communication between the Pixhawk, mini computer, and ground station.
Remember to adjust baud rates, port names, and other settings according to your specific hardware configuration. Also, ensure that your mini computer has sufficient processing power to handle the communication and any additional tasks you plan to run.
