# Sonar

Prerequisites
Hardware Setup:
Sonar sensor (e.g., HC-SR04) connected to the mini-computer (e.g., Raspberry Pi).
Pixhawk connected to the mini-computer via a serial connection.
Software Setup:
Install necessary libraries: pip install pymavlink RPi.GPIO


Explanation
Library Imports:
RPi.GPIO for interacting with the sonar sensor.
pymavlink for communication with Pixhawk.
Constants:
UPDATE_RATE: The rate at which the script updates (in Hz).
SAFETY_DISTANCE: The minimum distance to maintain from obstacles.
GPIO Setup:
Configure the GPIO pins for the sonar sensor.
Pixhawk Connection:
Establish a connection to the Pixhawk using mavutil.mavlink_connection.
Sonar Distance Measurement:
Function get_sonar_distance measures the distance using the sonar sensor.
Velocity Command:
Function send_velocity_command sends velocity commands to the Pixhawk.
Main Loop:
Continuously measure the distance using the sonar sensor.
Implement a simple obstacle avoidance strategy by moving backward if too close to an obstacle.
Send appropriate velocity commands to the Pixhawk.
Maintain the update rate.
Running the Script
Install Required Libraries:
bash
pip install pymavlink RPi.GPIO

Adjust Serial Port:
Modify the serial port (/dev/ttyACM0) and baud rate (115200) according to your setup.
Run the Script:
bash
python indoor_navigation.py

This script provides a basic implementation of an indoor navigation system using a sonar sensor and Pixhawk. You may need to adjust the obstacle detection and avoidance logic based on your specific requirements and environment. Additionally, ensure that your Pixhawk is configured correctly for indoor flight and that you have appropriate safety measures in place when testing the system.
